# Learning App

I need more experience with react and javascript in general and decided to build this app
it will be something simple, but it might or might not become more advanced in the future, idk lol

## Tech

This project uses:

-   React
-   Tailwind
-   TypeScript

## Installation

Simply type `npm i` in your console, while being in the correct directory
I will add more steps if I see the necessity
